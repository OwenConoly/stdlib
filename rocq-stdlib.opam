synopsis: "The Rocq Proof Assistant -- Standard Library"
description: """
Rocq is a formal proof management system. It provides
a formal language to write mathematical definitions, executable
algorithms and theorems together with an environment for
semi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs.

Typical applications include the certification of properties of
programming languages (e.g. the CompCert compiler certification
project, or the Bedrock verified low-level programming library), the
formalization of mathematics (e.g. the full formalization of the
Feit-Thompson theorem or homotopy type theory) and teaching.

This package includes the Rocq Standard Library, that is to say, the
set of modules usually bound to the Stdlib.* namespace."""
